# Minecolonies Research Tree

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

This app was built to provide additional views for the Minecraft Minecolonies mod research trees with the goal of making it easier to navigate through the three different categories and levels in each.

## Current Implementation

Currently, the app includes all research nodes in all three categories: civilian, combat, and technology. The building level requirements and the resource costs for each research node have been split into separate columns for readability (as opposed to the wiki which inlcudes them in a single tect block).

The categories are also separated into individual tabs located at the top of the page so as to limit the amount of scrolling required.

## Future Implementation

- Search function
- Linked entries
- Tree view (Select a node and see it's relationship)
